# Network Programming Assignments And Lab Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the lab exercises and assignments of the on-campus Network Programming course (IS F462) at BITS Pilani.

All the assignments were solved in a team of two, with my teammate being [Sankalp Sangle](https://github.com/sankalp-sangle).
