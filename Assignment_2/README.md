# Network Programming Assignment 2

This folder contains my solutions for assignment 2 of on-campus Network Programming (IS F462) course. `182_NP_assignment-2.pdf` contains the following two questions to be implemented:

* You are required to implement a chat server using two different approaches: multi-threaded and event-driven. Also, design a client program that sends uniform traffic to the server programs, in order to compare the two server programs based on average latency and throughput.

* You are required to implement a TFTP server program, as specified in [RFC 1350](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt).

More details and requirements can be found in `182_NP_assignment-2.pdf`.
