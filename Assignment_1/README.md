# Network Programming Assignment 1

This folder contains my solutions for assignment 1 of on-campus Network Programming (IS F462) course. `182_NP_assignment-1.pdf` contains the following two questions to be implemented:

* You are required to build a bash-like shell. Your program should not
use temporary files, popen(), system() library calls. It should only use system-call wrappers from the library. It should not use sh or bash shells to execute a command.

* You are required to implement a group messaging system using message queues provided by the UNIX OS.

More details and requirements can be found in `182_NP_assignment-1.pdf`.
